# Nimbus Cache (SOP Level) ‚Äî Cache & Export Operator

![Nimbus Cache HDA](../images/sop_nimbus_cache.png)
*The SOP-level HDA used for export/caching and version control.*

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose

**Nimbus Cache** is a SOP-level HDA designed to handle simulation and geometry caching with automatic version control, environment variable paths, and clean file naming.

Each time you trigger a cache, the tool automatically saves a backup copy of your current .hip file inside the same version directory ‚Äî ensuring that every cache version is fully traceable to the exact Houdini setup used to generate it.

This makes it ideal for maintaining version-safe, reproducible simulations in both individual and small-team production workflows.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Start

1. Drop **Nimbus Cache** in your SOP network after the node you want to cache.  
2. Pick **Extension** (e.g., `.bgeo.sc`) and set the **frame range**.  
3. Enable **Auto Versioning** (recommended), then **Save to Disk** (local) or create the **/out** ROP to send from OUT.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ UI Reference

#### A) Naming & Paths
Parameter	Description
Name	Logical cache name used for folder and file naming.
Cache Path	Full resolved output path (read-only). Derived automatically from the OBJ Nimbus environment variables (e.g. $CACHE).
Cache Directory	Root directory for the cache files (usually $CACHE). You can browse or override this path if needed.
Extension	Defines the file format for cached output. NimbusCache supports the following export types:


¬†¬†‚Ä¢ .bgeo.sc ‚Äî Standard Houdini geometry cache (fast & compressed). (Default option)
	
¬†¬†‚Ä¢ .vdb ‚Äî Sparse volumetric data (smoke, fire, fog).
	
¬†¬†‚Ä¢ .abc ‚Äî Alembic format for DCC interchange (e.g. Maya, Blender).
	
¬†¬†‚Ä¢ .usd ‚Äî USD layer export (for Solaris or Unreal workflows).
	
¬†¬†‚Ä¢ .hbjson ‚Äî Houdini Bake JSON (Niagara export for Unreal Engine).	

> Example Path
> E:/Houdini/NimbusDemo/cache/demo12/bgeo/nimbuscache/v003/nimbuscache_v003.$F4.bgeo.sc

üí° Tip:
Changing the extension automatically creates a corresponding subfolder (e.g. /bgeo/, /vdb/, /usd/) to keep cache formats organized.

### B) Versioning
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Auto Versioning** | Bumps to the next **major** version on save (e.g., `v003 ‚Üí v004`). |
| **Version slider** | Manually preview/set a version. |
| **Latest Version** | Jumps to the highest existing version on disk. |
| **Approved Cache** | Optional flag to mark a version as approved ( visual cue for the team ). |

> **Naming reminder**  
> HIP naming uses **minor + major** (e.g., `_001_v014`). Cache versions typically track **major**: `v001`, `v002`, `v003‚Ä¶`.

---

### C) Caching (bgeo)
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Load from Disk** | Switches the node to read existing files instead of cooking upstream. |
| **Save to Disk** | Writes the cache now (foreground). |
| **Save to Disk in Background** | Spawns a background process; keeps the UI responsive. |
| **Cancel Cook** | Stops the current write. |
| **Evaluate As** | `Frame Range` (sequence) or a single frame. |
| **Start/End/Inc** | Cache range; defaults to scene range. |
| **Initialize Simulation OPs** | Forces a clean sim state before caching. |
| **Enable Checkpoints** | Writes intermittent frames for long sims (resume options depend on your setup). |

---

### D) Out Node (Farm Hand-off)
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Create /out node** | Builds a paired **ROP NimbusCache** in `/out` with this node wired in. |
| **ROP Node** | The created node‚Äôs path (e.g., `/out/cache_nimbuscache`). Submit from **/out** for HQueue/Deadline. |

---

### E) Load
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Object Merge This Node** | Creates an Object Merge pointing back to this cache output for easy reuse elsewhere. |

---

### F) Email Notification
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Send Email Notification** | Sends a simple ‚Äúcache finished‚Äù email after completion. |
| **Email To** | Recipient(s) list. Useful for long sims or background writes. |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Output Examples

- Sequence:  

$CACHE/demo12/bgeo/nimbuscache/v003/nimbuscache_v003.$F4.bgeo.sc

Expands to:  

E:/Houdini/NimbusDemo/cache/demo12/bgeo/nimbuscache/v003/nimbuscache_v003.0031.bgeo.sc


- Switching to **Load from Disk** will read:  

.../v003/nimbuscache_v003.$F4.bgeo.sc


---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices

- Set **Project/Scene/Shot** on the **OBJ Nimbus** first ‚Äî all paths resolve from there.  
- Keep **Auto Versioning** on; don‚Äôt overwrite previous caches.  
- Use **Background Save** for heavy sims while you continue look-dev.  
- Create the **/out** ROP when you‚Äôre ready to submit to farm (HQueue/Deadline).  
- Use **Load from Disk** after a successful cache to lock work and speed up the scene.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting

- **Path shows blank or wrong drive** ‚Üí Check OBJ Nimbus and `$CACHE` variable.  
- **No files after save** ‚Üí Confirm the frame range and that you‚Äôre not on **Load from Disk**.  
- **Farm cannot find files** ‚Üí Ensure the cache directory is on a shared/network path visible to HQueue/Deadline workers.
