# Install

## Option A — Houdini Package (recommended)

1. Copy `houdini/packages/nimbus.json.example` to your Houdini packages folder and rename to `nimbus.json`.
2. Edit the `path_root` value to the path of this repository.
3. Start Houdini; Nimbus shelf and nodes should appear.

## Option B — HSITE

1. Set `HSITE` to the repo root (or copy `houdini/` content into your central HSITE).
2. Ensure `otls` folder resolves to `$HSITE/otls/Nimbus`.
