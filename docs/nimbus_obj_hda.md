# Nimbus (OBJ Level) — Project & Shot Manager

![Nimbus OBJ HDA](../images/obj_nimbus.png)
*Example: Nimbus node interface inside `/obj` level.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Nimbus (OBJ)** HDA is the core project manager.  
It helps artists define and manage the project structure, environment variables, and scene metadata.  
All Nimbus tools — like **Nimbus Cache (SOP)** and **ROP NimbusCache (OUT)** — read from the paths and project info set here.

## 🧭 Main Sections

🧭 1️⃣ Project Details
Parameter	Description
Project / Scene / Shot	Defines your project structure. The Scene field doesn’t strictly mean “sequence” — it can represent anything like sequence, element, or FX category (e.g. fire, destruction, water_interaction). Example: Project = NimbusDemo, Scene = Fire, Shot = SH010.
Enable Shot	Enables shot-level folder creation. When disabled, caching and review folders are generated only at the scene level (useful for standalone FX or lookdev).
Comment	Optional text note for internal tracking or quick identification of tasks.
Artist / Department	Automatically filled or editable fields used for tagging caches, flipbooks, and renders.
Project Details (📄)	Opens the main project directory in your file browser to verify paths.

🧩 2️⃣ File Controls
Control	Description
Empty hip_file	Displays the currently active HIP file. If no file is saved yet, the dropdown shows an empty entry. Once a versioned file is saved, it appears in the ver_list dropdown for easy access.
Save / Version Up	Saves the current .hip file in the project’s HIP directory and updates the version naming. Example: NimbusDemo_001_v001.hip where 001 = minor version and v001 = major version.
Version Up (Minor)	Increments only the minor version part (001 → 002), keeping the major version (v001) the same. This is useful for internal updates or WIP saves between major publishes. Example: NimbusDemo_001_v001.hip → NimbusDemo_002_v001.hip.

📂 3️⃣ Directory Paths
Path	Description
Assets / Cache / USD / Flipbook / Render	Auto-generated environment paths based on the project name and scene setup. Each path follows your base directory structure and can be accessed using Houdini’s environment variables.
Example Syntax:	E:/Houdini/NimbusDemo/cache
• E:/Houdini → Base directory where all projects are stored
• NimbusDemo → Current project name (can be any project)
• cache → Cache folder where .bgeo, .vdb, .abc, or .usd files are saved
Folder Icon	Opens the corresponding folder directly in your file browser for quick navigation.

### 4️⃣ Flipbook Section
| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cook Flipbook** | Renders a quick scene preview using the selected camera. |
| **Valid Frame Range** | Uses global frame range or custom override. |
| **Camera Path** | Choose the render camera (default: `/obj/cam1`). |
| **Override Camera Resolution** | Enables custom resolution for the flipbook. |
| **Flipbook Path / MP4 Path** | Displays where flipbook images and MP4 previews will be saved. |
| **Available Flipbook** | Lists all flipbooks saved for the shot. |
| **Play / Delete Flipbook** | Open or remove existing flipbook renders. |

---

## 💡 Tips

- Always set **Project** and **Shot** first — all cache, USD, and review paths depend on it.  
- Use **Version Up** before starting any simulation or render — this keeps versions clean and traceable.  
- The **Flipbook** tool automatically stores outputs in `$REVIEW`.  
- Folder icons are shortcuts — they open cache or flipbook directories instantly.
